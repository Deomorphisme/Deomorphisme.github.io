In the [previous article]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/ROADMAPCYBER_Understanding_Linux_File_Permissions_Part_1/), we covered the fundamental `rwx` permissions that everyone uses. But the Linux permission system has a few more tricks up its sleeve to handle special cases. These are the **special permissions**: SUID, SGID, and the sticky bit.

### The SUID Bit: Running as the Owner

The **SUID** (Set User ID) bit is a fascinating permission. When it's set on an executable file, it tells the system to run that program with the permissions of the file's **owner**, not the user who's running it.

You'll often see the `s` in place of the `x` in the owner's permission field when you run `ls -l`. For example, `rwsr-xr-x`.

A perfect example is the `passwd` command. When you run `passwd`, it needs to modify the `/etc/shadow` file, which only the `root` user can write to. The `passwd` command is owned by `root` and has the SUID bit set. This allows a normal user to change their password without having to be `root`.

#### Practice

Let's consider two user `hisoka` and `johndoe`. `johndoe` can't create file and directory in the directory `/home/hisoka/Dump` cause it's owned by `hisoka`.

```bash
drwxrwxr-x 2 hisoka hisoka     4096 Sep  1 02:04 Dump
```

Let's create a script that allow to create a new file containing `Hello I'm the new file`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <file_name>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    // Open the file for writing, create if it doesn't exist
    int fd = open(argv[1], O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("open");
        return 1;
    }

    // Write the content
    const char *content = "Hello I'm the new file\n";
    ssize_t bytes_written = write(fd, content, strlen(content));
    if (bytes_written == -1) {
        perror("write");
        close(fd);
        return 1;
    }

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}

```

_Everything works well_

But when `johndoe` tries to use this command...

![](assets/img/2025-09-06-Understanding-linux-permission-2/screen3.png)

It's important to know that `johndoe` has the permission to execute the script (`-rwxrwxr-x new_file.sh`) but the line 5 of the script doesn't match with permission set of the directory `Dump`.

Let's try to set the SUID bit and see how it's going.

Now `johndoe` can successfully create a new file with thanks to SUID bit.

> In security, it may be problematic because if the script executes critical operations on the system, it can lead to **information disclosure**, **data thief**, or **privilege escalation**.

### The SGID Bit: Sharing Group Privileges

The **SGID** (Set Group ID) bit works similarly to SUID, but for groups. When it's set on an executable file, the program runs with the permissions of the file's **group**.

The most common use of SGID, however, is on **directories**. When the SGID bit is set on a directory, any new file or subdirectory created within it will automatically inherit the **group ownership** of the parent directory.

This is extremely useful for collaborative projects. Imagine a directory shared by the `developers` group with the SGID bit set. If a user named `alice` creates a new file, it will automatically belong to the `developers` group. This means every member of that group can immediately access and edit it, without anyone needing to manually change permissions.

You'll see the SGID bit as an `s` in the group's permission field.
    

### The Sticky Bit: Protecting Shared Files

The **sticky bit** is a special permission that is almost always used on shared, world-writable directories. Its purpose is simple: it prevents users from deleting or renaming files they don't own.

You'll see the sticky bit as a `t` in the "others" permission field, like in the `/tmp` directory (`drwxrwxrwt`).

Without the sticky bit, any user could delete any file in `/tmp`, which would cause chaos. The sticky bit ensures that a user can only delete their own files, even though everyone has write access to the directory.

These special permissions are powerful tools that help maintain security and streamline collaboration on a Linux system. They're a core part of what makes Linux so flexible and robust.
